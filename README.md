Linköping University, 1st semester 2019


## Intended learning outcomes

- use knowledge of the common statistical distributions for building statistical models,
- apply main principles within point estimation, interval estimation and hypothesis testing,
- demonstrate a good understanding of the main concepts of Bayesian analysis,
- build linear regression models, check their uncertainty and perform model comparison,
- apply methods for sampling from large finite populations,
- apply the basic imputation methods for model building and estimation.
- present the underlying mathematical models for the above methods and perform theoretical calculations with these models.


## Course content

The course incorporates a wide collection of the most important concepts and methods in statistics.

The course covers:

- concept of probability,
- random variable, common statistical distributions and their properties,
- point- and interval estimation,
- hypothesis testing,
- simple and multiple linear regression, t-test and F-test; Residual and outlier analyses,
- likelihood, prior and posterior distribution, and Bayes theorem,
- concept of Markov chains,
 - sampling with and without replacement,
- imputation for model building.
